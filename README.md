🚦 Real-Time Traffic Flow Predictor

An AI-powered traffic flow prediction system that estimates the number of vehicles using real-time input like time, location, weather, road type, and average speed.  
Built using **Python, Machine Learning**, and a fully styled **Streamlit Dashboard**.

📌 Key Features

- 🧠 **ML Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- 📍 **Location-aware** prediction
- ⏰ **Time & Weather-based** inputs
- 🎛️ **Live Dashboard** built using Streamlit
- 📄 **Full PDF Report** included (project methodology & results)

📸 Dashboard Preview
Styled 2-column layout with real-time prediction display

🧭 Input Panel (Left):
📍 Location, 🌦️ Weather, 🛣️ Road Type, ⏰ Hour, 📅 Day, 🚗 Avg Speed

📊 Output Panel (Right):
Predicted Vehicle Count (AI-powered)

🧪 Synthetic Dataset Creation
✅ Wrote a custom Python script generate_dataset.py to generate realistic traffic data:

timestamp, location, vehicle_count, avg_speed, weather, road_type

📄 Saved as traffic_data.csv inside data/ folder

🧹Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
📘 Notebook: notebooks/eda.ipynb

Converted timestamp into hour, day, weekday

Applied Label Encoding for categorical features:

location, weather, road_type

Saved cleaned data as traffic_cleaned.csv

🧠  Model Training (ML Model)
🎯 Target: vehicle_count

🧪 Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor

📁 Script: src/model.py

✅ Performed:

Train-Test Split

Training

MAE, RMSE, R² Evaluation

📦 Saved final model as traffic_model.pkl

🚀 How to Run
git clone https://github.com/Youraj8271/real-time-traffic-prediction.git
cd real-time-traffic-prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py

🧠 How it Works
Collect simulated traffic data (timestamp, location, weather, speed)

Preprocess + encode with pandas + sklearn

Train model on 80% of the data

Predict vehicle_count based on real-time inputs

Show prediction on stylish Streamlit dashboard
